# homebrew-wine

Currently contains a single cask `wine-crossover` built from CrossOver19.0.1 source.
Wine-Crossover is within an app bundle like Winehq releases, this doesn't require XQuartz.


### Prerequisites;
Remove `winetricks` if installed as this includes a patched version of winetricks, winetricks requirments `cabextract`, `p7zip` & `unrar` will be installed.

### macOS Catalan additional requirement;
wine32on64 requires SIP to be disabled or you will receive the following error
```
wine: failed to initialize: failed to set the LDT entry for 32-bit code segment
```

### Additinal custom casks;
Now also contains `portingkit` & also `unofficial-wineskin` to install both projects, they work but lightly need additinal changes before attempting to get added upstream
